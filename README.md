### What is libft?
Libft is the first big project done at [Codam][2] and all other schools using the 42 curriculum.
In this project we implement many of the libc functions and other functions that will be used throughout the curriculum.
This project was later expanded upon to learn about low level optimization.

At [Codam][2] we are generally not allowed to use code that we haven't written ourselves.
This means that for most projects we are only allowed read(), write(), malloc() and free() from libc.

### What's in it?

First of all this project needs to conform to the [libft project][3].
Besides the project's specifications I've also included functions to use doubly linked lists and hash tables.

### Installation
The library is made using the included makefile.
