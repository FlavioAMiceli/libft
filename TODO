Write:
	strrev (makes optimization for some functions easy. Easy, but not ideal.)
	strlcat crashes if delim is 1 byte after n or soemthing? Ask Liewe.

Rewrite using optimizable functions:
	memmove

Optimize:
	memchr

Optimize (low priority):
	range(_step)
	strrchr

Generalize:
	set_magic (for strlen and memchr)
	count_words (in strsplit)
